These are files containing amplitudes for Favre waves in channels.
Two sets of data are present, taken from the work of Favre in the 1930s and
from the 1994 paper of Treske.
Data for different h0 values can be compared, on the same plot amplitude
vs Froude number, where the Froude number is defined as
$|u_0 - \sigma| / \sqrt{g h_0}$.

	abstract = {New, detailed investigations of the formation of surge waves in open channels are presented in this paper. These supplement the experiments of Favre and also include measurements in a trapezoidal channel. New effects were observed in this type of channel, which is highly relevant in practice. The measurements allow a classification to be made which leads to a better understanding of this type of surge wave. The measurements also provide important design criteria for the practising engineer as well as data for the verification and further development of mathematical models for describing such phenomena.},
