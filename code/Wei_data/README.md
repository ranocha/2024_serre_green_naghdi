This directory contains the potential solutions data
extracted from Wei et al 1995
(https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022112095002813).

In particular the file naming is the following:
dhEPSILONVALUEtTILDEVALUE_FNPF.txt
for the potential flow solutions.
We recall that EPSILON = (h_1 - h_0) / h_0 and that
tTILDE = t * sqrt(g / h_0).
The first column contains the space coordinates
in units of h_0.
The second column contains the water height perturbation
from h_0 in terms of h_0.
